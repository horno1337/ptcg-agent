# PTCG ABC agent

Kaggle Simulation agent for the Pokémon TCG AI Battle Challenge. README.md has
the architecture, tag lineage, post-mortems (research log), and workflows —
read it before proposing strategy changes; every rule below was paid for on
the ladder.

## Rules of the codebase

- Behavior lives in four files: `agent/policy.py` (dispatcher + rules),
  `agent/search_policy.py` (search), `agent/model.py` (inference),
  `agent/features.py` (encoding, shared with the torch trainer — never let
  train/inference features drift). `safety.py` stays paranoid and dumb; it
  must never depend on policy internals. `obsview.py`/`cards.py` are
  read-only helpers; no game logic.
- A crash, invalid action, or timeout is an instant ladder loss. Any change
  to `agent/` must keep `python tests/test_safety.py` green, and every layer
  must fail soft into the next (search -> reflex -> rules -> safety repair).
- Feature changes: bump `FEAT_VERSION` in features.py, append-only scalars;
  old weights load through the compat shim in model.py.
- `data/*.json` and `agent/meta_decks.json` are generated
  (`tools/dump_cards.py`, `tools/mine_meta_decks.py`) — never hand-edit.
- Engine source and sample bundle are competition-use-only and stay OUTSIDE
  the repo (`~/Desktop/ptcg_engine/`, `~/Desktop/sample_submission/`);
  `engine/` is gitignored; `cg/libcg.so` is injected into the tarball at
  build time only — never committed or pushed.
- Time bank is LARGE — do not treat compute as scarce. The ladder gives
  ~600s overage per game (`actTimeout=0`; thinking drains `remainingOverageTime`)
  across ~65 of our decisions, i.e. **~5–9s available per decision**, and the
  shipped reflex agent spends ~1s per *game* (<0.2% of budget). We are NOT
  time-starved: we can afford many search iterations / seconds of compute per
  decision. The v2/v3 "det starvation" was self-imposed per-decision throttling
  plus the value-net / strategy-fusion failures — NOT a total-time limit. When
  testing search, SPEND the budget (raise the per-decision budget and the
  world/iteration counts), keeping a safety reserve so the clock never reaches
  zero (instant loss). Unknown to measure empirically on the ladder: the real
  per-iteration wall-cost on the competition CPU (don't assume a fixed slowdown).
- Runtime search (PIMC) is retired (`search_policy.ENABLED = False`) — it lost on
  the ladder even after local parity (v2/v3 post-mortems), the root cause being
  strategy fusion, not lack of time. SO-ISMCTS (`agent/ismcts.py`) is the
  corrected-search prototype. `eval_search.py` force-enables search for
  experiments; validate any search change with it, and now spend a realistic
  per-decision budget (seconds), not the old throttled `--budget 0.03`.

## Evaluation & gates

- Local win rates do not predict ladder rank; use them only for A/B between
  our own agents (150+ games, paired seats) and crash-catching. 60-game
  evals swing ±13%.
- PRIMARY ship gate for weights: candidate >= champion on
  `eval_ab.py --opp pool:8` (160 games/net). Secondary: mirror 160+,
  `--opp meta:<i>` vs a threat deck, `eval.py 200 random`. Mirror is never
  sufficient alone — it inverted on the v5 failure. Local gates propose;
  the ladder disposes.
- Corpus rule: band-representative games (our own ladder episodes, both
  seats) are the base; top-team scouting is seasoning, not foundation.

## Training

- Venv: `~/.venvs/ptcg-rl` (torch+CUDA). Works: outcome-weighted BC on
  episode logs; anchored league PPO (`--league-rules 0.30 --league-random
  0.25 --bc-anchor <episodes> --lr 5e-5`). Dead ends: vanilla PPO
  fine-tuning, mirror-only self-play, bigger nets on the same corpus, pure
  top-play BC. Anti-passive: league_random seats + `gen_antipassive.py`
  demos in the anchor dir.
- Flywheel: `tools/selfplay_search.py` generates search self-play in episode
  format; retrain via the same `--bc` path. Episode downloads land in
  `~/Desktop/ptcg_episodes/` (user does this manually); refresh
  `meta_decks.json` after new downloads.

## Submission discipline

The ladder is the only real eval; every submission is an A/B measurement.

- One change per submission. Deck edits (`decks/deck.csv`) and agent edits
  go in separate commits — never mixed. The deck stays frozen while training
  data is deck-conditioned.
- Commit `agent/weights.npz` deliberately (`git add -f`) before packaging so
  the ladder result maps to exact code+weights. Tag every package on a
  clean tree.
- **The user names the tag and approves every upload** — training/eval/
  commit chains may run autonomously; `kaggle submit` never does.
- Current state: cvkpaper-v4 (reflex-only, ft3 weights fa0fc1c) carries the
  team score at ~655. Full lineage and post-mortems: README.
